# Quarantine Folder

This folder stores malicious files that have been isolated by the Device Scanner.

## Purpose
- Automatically quarantines detected threats
- Keeps malicious files isolated from the system
- Stores metadata about each quarantined file

## Structure
When files are quarantined, two files are created:
1. `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_filename.ext` - The quarantined file
2. `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_filename.ext.json` - Metadata about the threat

## Safety
- Files in this folder are isolated and cannot execute
- Review files before permanent deletion
- Old files are automatically cleaned after 30 days (configurable)

## Important
- Do NOT manually execute files in this folder
- Use the API endpoints to manage quarantined files
- Regularly review and clean old quarantine files

This .gitkeep file ensures the folder is tracked by Git even when empty.
